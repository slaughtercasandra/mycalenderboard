Task Board

Task Board is a simple Kanban board for task management. It allows users to add tasks, track their progress through different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done), and delete tasks when they're completed or no longer needed.

Features

Task Management: Add tasks with titles, due dates, and descriptions.
Kanban-style Board: Organize tasks into columns representing different stages of completion.
Drag and Drop: Easily move tasks between columns with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.


Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript (jQuery, jQuery UI)


To get started with Task Board, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a web browser. No additional setup or installation is required.

Usage

Click the "Add Task" button to create a new task.
Fill in the task details, including title, due date, and description.
Tasks can be dragged and dropped between the "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns to update their status.
To delete a task, click the "Delete" button on the task card.
